## Ethical AI Guidelines
- **Creative Ownership:** Clearly define user ownership of AI-assisted compositions.
- **Bias Mitigation:** Actively work to prevent AI from perpetuating genre or stylistic biases.
- **Transparency:** Explain AI's role as a tool, not a replacement for human creativity.
- **Attribution:** Consider mechanisms for optional AI assistance attribution.
